Want the script on the path?
    1. move the whole folder to to /opt/MarkLogic
    2. add it to path EXPORT PATH=somedir:$PATH
    3. add the export statement to the preferences files for your shell
       e.g. .bashrc
            # assuming you copied the library to AppSetup
            export APPSET_HOME="/opt/MarkLogic/AppSetup/"
            export PATH=$APPSET_HOME:$PATH

    4. Go --nuts-- panda:
       $ ml-install
